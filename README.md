# React Form Validity

Great project for learning form validation and learning best user experience. Key is to not show error at first, but when user leaves focus out of touched input, checking if that input value is valid and if not, then displaying message and making input red so the user knows where's the problem. Button is disabled if any of input values are invalid.
